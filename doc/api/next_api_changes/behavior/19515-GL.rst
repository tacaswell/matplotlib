Colorbars now have pan and zoom functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interactive plots with colorbars can now be zoomed and panned on
the colorbar axis. This adjusts the *vmin* and *vmax* of the
``ScalarMappable`` associated with the colorbar. This is currently
only enabled for continuous norms. Norms used with contourf and
categoricals, such as ``BoundaryNorm`` and ``NoNorm``, have the
interactive capability disabled by default. ``cb.ax.set_navigate()``
can be used to set whether a colorbar axes is interactive or not.
