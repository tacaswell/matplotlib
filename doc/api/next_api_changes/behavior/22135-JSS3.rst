Figure & subfigure clearing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a bug in which ``Figure.clf()`` and ``Figure.clear()`` were broken 
when ``Figure`` contained axes not stored in `Figure._localaxes`.  Moved the
``clear`` and ``clf`` methods to ``FigureBase``, so ``Subfigure``s can now be
independently cleared. Added a routine to clear ``Figure.subfigs`` when 
``Figure.clear()`` is called. This effects the API as it removes active 
subfigure references when clearing a figure.
