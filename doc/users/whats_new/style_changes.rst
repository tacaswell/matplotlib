Changes to the default style
----------------------------

The most important feature in matplotlib 2.0 are the changes to the
default style.

While it is impossible to select the best default for all cases, these
are designed to work well in the most common cases.

These changes include:

- By default, the number of points displayed in a legend is now 1.

- The ''Blues'' colormap has been adjusted to be perceptually uniform.  The old
  ``blues`` colormap is available under the name ``legacy_Blues``.
