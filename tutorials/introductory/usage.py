##############################################################################
#
# A simple example
# ================
#
# Matplotlib graphs your data on `~.figure.Figure`\s (e.g., windows, Jupyter
# widgets, etc.), each of which can contain one or more `~.axes.Axes`, an
# area where points can be specified in terms of x-y coordinates, or theta-r
# in a polar plot, x-y-z in a 3D plot, etc.  The simplest way of
# creating a figure with an axes is using `.pyplot.subplots`. We can then use
# `.Axes.plot` to draw some data on the axes:

fig, ax = plt.subplots()  # Create a figure containing a single axes.
ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])  # Plot some data on the axes.

###############################################################################
# Many other plotting libraries or languages do not require you to explicitly
# create an axes.  For example, in MATLAB, one can just do
#
# .. code-block:: matlab
#
#    plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])  % MATLAB plot.
#
# and get the desired graph.
#
# In fact, you can do the same in Matplotlib: for each `~.axes.Axes` graphing
# method, there is a corresponding function in the :mod:`matplotlib.pyplot`
# module that performs that plot on the "current" axes, creating that axes (and
# its parent figure) if they don't exist yet.  So, the previous example can be
# written more shortly as

plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])  # Matplotlib plot.

###############################################################################
# .. _figure_parts:
#
# Parts of a Figure
# =================
#
# Here is a more detailed layout of the components of a Matplotlib figure.
#
# .. image:: ../../_static/anatomy.png
#
# :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`
# ----------------------------------
#
# The **whole** figure.  The figure keeps
# track of all the child :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`, a group of
# 'special' artists (titles, figure legends, etc), and the **canvas**.
# (The canvas is not the primary focus. It is crucial as it is the
# object that actually does the drawing to get you your plot, but as
# the user, it is mostly invisible to you).  A figure can contain any
# number of :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`, but will typically have
# at least one.
#
# The easiest way to create a new figure is with pyplot::
#
#    fig = plt.figure()  # an empty figure with no Axes
#    fig, ax = plt.subplots()  # a figure with a single Axes
#    fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)  # a figure with a 2x2 grid of Axes
#
# It's convenient to create the axes together with the figure, but you can
# also add axes later on, allowing for more complex axes layouts.
#
# :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
# ------------------------------
#
# This is what you think of as 'a plot'. It is the region of the image
# with the data space. A given figure
# can contain many Axes, but a given :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
# object can only be in one :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`.  The
# Axes contains two (or three in the case of 3D)
# :class:`~matplotlib.axis.Axis` objects (be aware of the difference
# between **Axes** and **Axis**) which take care of the data limits (the
# data limits can also be controlled via the :meth:`.axes.Axes.set_xlim` and
# :meth:`.axes.Axes.set_ylim` methods).  Each :class:`~.axes.Axes` has a title
# (set via :meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_title`), an x-label (set via
# :meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xlabel`), and a y-label set via
# :meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_ylabel`).
#
# The :class:`~.axes.Axes` class and its member functions are the primary entry
# point to working with the OO interface.
#
# :class:`~matplotlib.axis.Axis`
# ------------------------------
#
# These are the objects most similar to a number line.
# They set graph limits and generate ticks (the marks
# on the axis) and ticklabels (strings labeling the ticks).  The location of
# the ticks is determined by a `~matplotlib.ticker.Locator` object and the
# ticklabel strings are formatted by a `~matplotlib.ticker.Formatter`.  The
# combination of the correct `.Locator` and `.Formatter` gives very fine
# control over the tick locations and labels.
#
# :class:`~matplotlib.artist.Artist`
# ----------------------------------
#
# Basically, everything visible on the figure is an artist (even
# `.Figure`, `Axes <.axes.Axes>`, and `~.axis.Axis` objects).  This includes
# `.Text` objects, `.Line2D` objects, :mod:`.collections` objects, `.Patch`
# objects, etc... When the figure is rendered, all of the
# artists are drawn to the **canvas**.  Most Artists are tied to an Axes; such
# an Artist cannot be shared by multiple Axes, or moved from one to another.
#
# .. _input_types:
#
# Types of inputs to plotting functions
# =====================================
#
# All of plotting functions expect `numpy.array` or `numpy.ma.masked_array` as
# input.  Classes that are similar to arrays ('array-like') such as `pandas`
# data objects and `numpy.matrix` may not work as intended.  Common convention
# is to convert these to `numpy.array` objects prior to plotting.
#
# For example, to convert a `pandas.DataFrame` ::
#
#   a = pandas.DataFrame(np.random.rand(4, 5), columns = list('abcde'))
#   a_asarray = a.values
#
# and to convert a `numpy.matrix` ::
#
#   b = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
#   b_asarray = np.asarray(b)
#
# .. _coding_styles:
#
# The object-oriented interface and the pyplot interface
# ======================================================
#
# As noted above, there are essentially two ways to use Matplotlib:
#
# - Explicitly create figures and axes, and call methods on them (the
#   "object-oriented (OO) style").
# - Rely on pyplot to automatically create and manage the figures and axes, and
#   use pyplot functions for plotting.
#
# So one can do (OO-style)

x = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)  # Sample data.

# Note that even in the OO-style, we use `.pyplot.figure` to create the figure.
fig, ax = plt.subplots()  # Create a figure and an axes.
ax.plot(x, x, label='linear')  # Plot some data on the axes.
ax.plot(x, x**2, label='quadratic')  # Plot more data on the axes...
ax.plot(x, x**3, label='cubic')  # ... and some more.
ax.set_xlabel('x label')  # Add an x-label to the axes.
ax.set_ylabel('y label')  # Add a y-label to the axes.
ax.set_title("Simple Plot")  # Add a title to the axes.
ax.legend()  # Add a legend.

###############################################################################
# or (pyplot-style)

x = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)  # Sample data.

plt.plot(x, x, label='linear')  # Plot some data on the (implicit) axes.
plt.plot(x, x**2, label='quadratic')  # etc.
plt.plot(x, x**3, label='cubic')
plt.xlabel('x label')
plt.ylabel('y label')
plt.title("Simple Plot")
plt.legend()

###############################################################################
# In addition, there is a third approach, for the case when embedding
# Matplotlib in a GUI application, which completely drops pyplot, even for
# figure creation.  We won't discuss it here; see the corresponding section in
# the gallery for more info (:ref:`user_interfaces`).
#
# Matplotlib's documentation and examples use both the OO and the pyplot
# approaches (which are equally powerful), and you should feel free to use
# either (however, it is preferable pick one of them and stick to it, instead
# of mixing them).  In general, we suggest to restrict pyplot to interactive
# plotting (e.g., in a Jupyter notebook), and to prefer the OO-style for
# non-interactive plotting (in functions and scripts that are intended to be
# reused as part of a larger project).
#
# .. note::
#
#    In older examples, you may find examples that instead used the so-called
#    ``pylab`` interface, via ``from pylab import *``. This star-import
#    imports everything both from pyplot and from :mod:`numpy`, so that one
#    could do ::
#
#       x = linspace(0, 2, 100)
#       plot(x, x, label='linear')
#       ...
#
#    for an even more MATLAB-like style.  This approach is strongly discouraged
#    nowadays and deprecated. It is only mentioned here because you may still
#    encounter it in the wild.
#
# If you need to make the same plots over and over
# again with different data sets, use the recommended signature function below.

#
# .. _backends:
#
# Backends
# ========
#
# .. _what-is-a-backend:
#
# What is a backend?
# ------------------
#
# A lot of documentation on the website and in the mailing lists refers
# to the "backend" and many new users are confused by this term.
# Matplotlib targets many different use cases and output formats.  Some
# people use Matplotlib interactively from the Python shell and have
# plotting windows pop up when they type commands.  Some people run
# `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ notebooks and draw inline plots for
# quick data analysis. Others embed Matplotlib into graphical user
# interfaces like PyQt or PyGObject to build rich applications.  Some
# people use Matplotlib in batch scripts to generate postscript images
# from numerical simulations, and still others run web application
# servers to dynamically serve up graphs.
#
# To support all of these use cases, Matplotlib can target different
# outputs, and each of these capabilities is called a backend; the
# "frontend" is the user facing code, i.e., the plotting code, whereas the
# "backend" does all the hard work behind-the-scenes to make the figure.
# There are two types of backends: user interface backends (for use in
# PyQt/PySide, PyGObject, Tkinter, wxPython, or macOS/Cocoa); also referred to
# as "interactive backends") and hardcopy backends to make image files
# (PNG, SVG, PDF, PS; also referred to as "non-interactive backends").
#
# Selecting a backend
# -------------------
#
# There are three ways to configure your backend:
#
# - The :rc:`backend` parameter in your :file:`matplotlibrc` file
# - The :envvar:`MPLBACKEND` environment variable
# - The function :func:`matplotlib.use`
#
# Below is a more detailed description.
#
# If there is more than one configuration present, the last one from the
# list takes precedence; e.g. calling :func:`matplotlib.use()` will override
# the setting in your :file:`matplotlibrc`.
#
# Without a backend explicitly set, Matplotlib automatically detects a usable
# backend based on what is available on your system and on whether a GUI event
# loop is already running.  The first usable backend in the following list is
# selected: MacOSX, QtAgg, GTK4Agg, Gtk3Agg, TkAgg, WxAgg, Agg.  The last, Agg,
# is a non-interactive backend that can only write to files.  It is used on
# Linux, if Matplotlib cannot connect to either an X display or a Wayland
# display.
#
# Here is a detailed description of the configuration methods:
#
# #. Setting :rc:`backend` in your :file:`matplotlibrc` file::
#
#        backend : qtagg   # use pyqt with antigrain (agg) rendering
#
#    See also :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing`.
#
# #. Setting the :envvar:`MPLBACKEND` environment variable:
#
#    You can set the environment variable either for your current shell or for
#    a single script.
#
#    On Unix::
#
#         > export MPLBACKEND=qtagg
#         > python simple_plot.py
#
#         > MPLBACKEND=qtagg python simple_plot.py
#
#    On Windows, only the former is possible::
#
#         > set MPLBACKEND=qtagg
#         > python simple_plot.py
#
#    Setting this environment variable will override the ``backend`` parameter
#    in *any* :file:`matplotlibrc`, even if there is a :file:`matplotlibrc` in
#    your current working directory. Therefore, setting :envvar:`MPLBACKEND`
#    globally, e.g. in your :file:`.bashrc` or :file:`.profile`, is discouraged
#    as it might lead to counter-intuitive behavior.
#
# #. If your script depends on a specific backend you can use the function
#    :func:`matplotlib.use`::
#
#       import matplotlib
#       matplotlib.use('qtagg')
#
#    This should be done before any figure is created, otherwise Matplotlib may
#    fail to switch the backend and raise an ImportError.
#
#    Using `~matplotlib.use` will require changes in your code if users want to
#    use a different backend.  Therefore, you should avoid explicitly calling
#    `~matplotlib.use` unless absolutely necessary.
#
# .. _the-builtin-backends:
#
# The builtin backends
# --------------------
#
# By default, Matplotlib should automatically select a default backend which
# allows both interactive work and plotting from scripts, with output to the
# screen and/or to a file, so at least initially, you will not need to worry
# about the backend.  The most common exception is if your Python distribution
# comes without :mod:`tkinter` and you have no other GUI toolkit installed.
# This happens on certain Linux distributions, where you need to install a
# Linux package named ``python-tk`` (or similar).
#
# If, however, you want to write graphical user interfaces, or a web
# application server
# (:doc:`/gallery/user_interfaces/web_application_server_sgskip`), or need a
# better understanding of what is going on, read on. To make things easily
# more customizable for graphical user interfaces, Matplotlib separates
# the concept of the renderer (the thing that actually does the drawing)
# from the canvas (the place where the drawing goes).  The canonical
# renderer for user interfaces is ``Agg`` which uses the `Anti-Grain
# Geometry`_ C++ library to make a raster (pixel) image of the figure; it
# is used by the ``QtAgg``, ``GTK4Agg``, ``GTK3Agg``, ``wxAgg``, ``TkAgg``, and
# ``macosx`` backends.  An alternative renderer is based on the Cairo library,
# used by ``QtCairo``, etc.
#
# For the rendering engines, users can also distinguish between `vector
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics>`_ or `raster
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics>`_ renderers.  Vector
# graphics languages issue drawing commands like "draw a line from this
# point to this point" and hence are scale free. Raster backends
# generate a pixel representation of the line whose accuracy depends on a
# DPI setting.
#
# Here is a summary of the Matplotlib renderers (there is an eponymous
# backend for each; these are *non-interactive backends*, capable of
# writing to a file):
#
# ========  =========  =======================================================
# Renderer  Filetypes  Description
# ========  =========  =======================================================
# AGG       png        raster_ graphics -- high quality images using the
#                      `Anti-Grain Geometry`_ engine
# PDF       pdf        vector_ graphics -- `Portable Document Format`_
# PS        ps, eps    vector_ graphics -- Postscript_ output
# SVG       svg        vector_ graphics -- `Scalable Vector Graphics`_
# PGF       pgf, pdf   vector_ graphics -- using the pgf_ package
# Cairo     png, ps,   raster_ or vector_ graphics -- using the Cairo_ library
#           pdf, svg
# ========  =========  =======================================================
#
# To save plots using the non-interactive backends, use the
# ``matplotlib.pyplot.savefig('filename')`` method.
#
# These are the user interfaces and renderer combinations supported;
# these are *interactive backends*, capable of displaying to the screen
# and using appropriate renderers from the table above to write to
# a file:
#
# ========= ================================================================
# Backend   Description
# ========= ================================================================
# QtAgg     Agg rendering in a Qt_ canvas (requires PyQt_ or `Qt for Python`_,
#           a.k.a. PySide).  This backend can be activated in IPython with
#           ``%matplotlib qt``.
# ipympl    Agg rendering embedded in a Jupyter widget.  (requires ipympl).

#           IPython with ``%matplotlib gtk3``.
# GTK4Agg   Agg rendering to a GTK_ 4.x canvas (requires PyGObject_,
#           and pycairo_ or cairocffi_).  This backend can be activated in
#           IPython with ``%matplotlib gtk4``.

#           ``%matplotlib notebook``.
# WebAgg    On ``show()`` will start a tornado server with an interactive
#           figure.

# ipympl
# ^^^^^^
#
# The Jupyter widget ecosystem is moving too fast to support directly in
# Matplotlib.  To install ipympl:
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    pip install ipympl
#    jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipympl
#
# or
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    conda install ipympl -c conda-forge
#
# See `jupyter-matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/jupyter-matplotlib>`__
# for more details.
#
# .. _QT_API-usage:
#
# How do I select PyQt5 or PySide2?
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The :envvar:`QT_API` environment variable can be set to either ``pyqt5`` or
# ``pyside2`` to use ``PyQt5`` or ``PySide2``, respectively.
#
# Since the default value for the bindings to be used is ``PyQt5``, Matplotlib
# first tries to import it. If the import fails, it tries to import
# ``PySide2``.
#
# Using non-builtin backends
# --------------------------
# More generally, any importable backend can be selected by using any of the
# methods above. If ``name.of.the.backend`` is the module containing the
# backend, use ``module://name.of.the.backend`` as the backend name, e.g.
# ``matplotlib.use('module://name.of.the.backend')``.
#
#
# .. _interactive-mode:
#
# What is interactive mode?
# =========================
#
# Use of an interactive backend (see :ref:`what-is-a-backend`)
# permits--but does not by itself require or ensure--plotting
# to the screen.  Whether and when plotting to the screen occurs,
# and whether a script or shell session continues after a plot
# is drawn on the screen, depends on the functions and methods
# that are called, and on a state variable that determines whether
# Matplotlib is in "interactive mode."  The default Boolean value is set
# by the :file:`matplotlibrc` file, and may be customized like any other
# configuration parameter (see :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing`).  It
# may also be set via :func:`matplotlib.interactive`, and its
# value may be queried via :func:`matplotlib.is_interactive`.  Turning
# interactive mode on and off in the middle of a stream of plotting
# commands, whether in a script or in a shell, is rarely needed
# and potentially confusing. In the following, we will assume all
# plotting is done with interactive mode either on or off.
#
# .. note::
#    Major changes related to interactivity, and in particular the
#    role and behavior of :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.show`, were made in the
#    transition to Matplotlib version 1.0, and bugs were fixed in
#    1.0.1.  Here we describe the version 1.0.1 behavior for the
#    primary interactive backends, with the partial exception of
#    *macosx*.
#
# Interactive mode may also be turned on via :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.ion`,
# and turned off via :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.ioff`.
#
# .. note::
#    Interactive mode works with suitable backends in ipython and in
#    the ordinary Python shell, but it does *not* work in the IDLE IDE.
#    If the default backend does not support interactivity, an interactive
#    backend can be explicitly activated using any of the methods discussed
#    in `What is a backend?`_.
#
#
# Interactive example
# --------------------
#
# From an ordinary Python prompt, or after invoking ipython with no options,
# try this::
#
#     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#     plt.ion()
#     plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])
#
# This will pop up a plot window. Your terminal prompt will remain active, so
# that you can type additional commands such as::
#
#     plt.title("interactive test")
#     plt.xlabel("index")
#
# On most interactive backends, the figure window will also be updated if you
# change it via the object-oriented interface. That is, get a reference to the
# `~matplotlib.axes.Axes` instance, and call a method of that instance::
#
#     ax = plt.gca()
#     ax.plot([3.1, 2.2])
#
# If you are using certain backends (like ``macosx``), or an older version
# of Matplotlib, you may not see the new line added to the plot immediately.
# In this case, you need to explicitly call :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw`
# in order to update the plot::
#
#     plt.draw()
#
#
# Non-interactive example
# -----------------------
#
# Start a new session as per the previous example, but now
# turn interactive mode off::
#
#     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#     plt.ioff()
#     plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])
#
# Nothing happened--or at least nothing has shown up on the
# screen (unless you are using *macosx* backend, which is
# anomalous).  To make the plot appear, you need to do this::
#
#     plt.show()
#
# Now you see the plot, but your terminal command line is
# unresponsive; `.pyplot.show()` *blocks* the input
# of additional commands until you manually close the plot
# window.
#
# Using a blocking function has benefits to users. Suppose a user
# needs a script that plots the contents of a file to the screen.
# The user may want to look at that plot, and then end the script.
# Without a blocking command such as ``show()``, the script would
# flash up the plot and then end immediately, leaving nothing on
# the screen.
#
# In addition, non-interactive mode delays all drawing until
# ``show()`` is called. This is more efficient than redrawing
# the plot each time a line in the script adds a new feature.
#
# Prior to version 1.0, ``show()`` generally could not be called
# more than once in a single script (although sometimes one
# could get away with it). For version 1.0.1 and above, this
# restriction is lifted, so one can write a script like this::
#
#     import numpy as np
#     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#
#     plt.ioff()
#     for i in range(3):
#         plt.plot(np.random.rand(10))
#         plt.show()
#
# This makes three plots, one at a time. That is, the second plot will show up
# once the first plot is closed.
#
# Summary
# -------
#
# In interactive mode, pyplot functions automatically draw
# to the screen.
#
# When plotting interactively, if using
# object method calls in addition to pyplot functions, then
# call :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw` whenever you want to
# refresh the plot.
#
# Use non-interactive mode in scripts in which you want to
# generate one or more figures and display them before ending
# or generating a new set of figures.  In that case, use
# :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.show` to display the figure(s) and
# to block execution until you have manually destroyed them.
#
# .. _performance:
#
# Performance
# ===========
#
# Whether exploring data in interactive mode or programmatically
# saving lots of plots, rendering performance can be a challenging
# bottleneck in your pipeline. Matplotlib provides multiple
# ways to greatly reduce rendering time at the cost of a slight
# change (to a settable tolerance) in your plot's appearance.
# The methods available to reduce rendering time depend on the
# type of plot that is being created.
#
# Line segment simplification
# ---------------------------
#
# For plots that have line segments (e.g. typical line plots, outlines
# of polygons, etc.), rendering performance can be controlled by
# :rc:`path.simplify` and :rc:`path.simplify_threshold`, which
# can be defined e.g. in the :file:`matplotlibrc` file (see
# :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing` for more information about
# the :file:`matplotlibrc` file). :rc:`path.simplify` is a Boolean
# indicating whether or not line segments are simplified at all.
# :rc:`path.simplify_threshold` controls how much line segments are simplified;
# higher thresholds result in quicker rendering.
#
# The following script will first display the data without any
# simplification, and then display the same data with simplification.
# Try interacting with both of them::
#
#   import numpy as np
#   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#   import matplotlib as mpl
#
#   # Setup, and create the data to plot
#   y = np.random.rand(100000)
#   y[50000:] *= 2
#   y[np.geomspace(10, 50000, 400).astype(int)] = -1
#   mpl.rcParams['path.simplify'] = True
#
#   mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'] = 0.0
#   plt.plot(y)
#   plt.show()
#
#   mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'] = 1.0
#   plt.plot(y)
#   plt.show()
#
# Matplotlib currently defaults to a conservative simplification
# threshold of ``1/9``. To change default settings to use a different
# value, change the :file:`matplotlibrc` file. Alternatively, users
# can create a new style for interactive plotting (with maximal
# simplification) and another style for publication quality plotting
# (with minimal simplification) and activate them as necessary. See
# :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing` for instructions on
# how to perform these actions.
#
#
# The simplification works by iteratively merging line segments
# into a single vector until the next line segment's perpendicular
# distance to the vector (measured in display-coordinate space)
# is greater than the ``path.simplify_threshold`` parameter.
#
# .. note::
#   Changes related to how line segments are simplified were made
#   in version 2.1. Rendering time will still be improved by these
#   parameters prior to 2.1, but rendering time for some kinds of
#   data will be vastly improved in versions 2.1 and greater.
#
# Marker simplification
# ---------------------
#
# Markers can also be simplified, albeit less robustly than
# line segments. Marker simplification is only available
# to :class:`~matplotlib.lines.Line2D` objects (through the
# ``markevery`` property). Wherever
# :class:`~matplotlib.lines.Line2D` construction parameters
# are passed through, such as
# :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.plot` and
# :meth:`matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`, the ``markevery``
# parameter can be used::
#
#   plt.plot(x, y, markevery=10)
#
# The ``markevery`` argument allows for naive subsampling, or an
# attempt at evenly spaced (along the *x* axis) sampling. See the
# :doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/markevery_demo`
# for more information.
#
# Splitting lines into smaller chunks
# -----------------------------------
#
# If you are using the Agg backend (see :ref:`what-is-a-backend`),
# then you can make use of :rc:`agg.path.chunksize`
# This allows users to specify a chunk size, and any lines with
# greater than that many vertices will be split into multiple
# lines, each of which has no more than ``agg.path.chunksize``
# many vertices. (Unless ``agg.path.chunksize`` is zero, in
# which case there is no chunking.) For some kind of data,
# chunking the line up into reasonable sizes can greatly
# decrease rendering time.
#
# The following script will first display the data without any
# chunk size restriction, and then display the same data with
# a chunk size of 10,000. The difference can best be seen when
# the figures are large, try maximizing the GUI and then
# interacting with them::
#
#   import numpy as np
#   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#   import matplotlib as mpl
#   mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'] = 1.0
#
#   # Setup, and create the data to plot
#   y = np.random.rand(100000)
#   y[50000:] *= 2
#   y[np.geomspace(10, 50000, 400).astype(int)] = -1
#   mpl.rcParams['path.simplify'] = True
#
#   mpl.rcParams['agg.path.chunksize'] = 0
#   plt.plot(y)
#   plt.show()
#
#   mpl.rcParams['agg.path.chunksize'] = 10000
#   plt.plot(y)
#   plt.show()
#
# Legends
# -------
#
# The default legend behavior for axes attempts to find the location
# that covers the fewest data points (``loc='best'``). This can be a
# very expensive computation if there are lots of data points. In
# this case, you may want to provide a specific location.
#
# Using the *fast* style
# ----------------------
#
# The *fast* style can be used to automatically set
# simplification and chunking parameters to reasonable
# settings to speed up plotting large amounts of data.
# The following code runs it::
#
#   import matplotlib.style as mplstyle
#   mplstyle.use('fast')
#
# It is very lightweight, so it works well with other
# styles. Be sure the fast style is applied last
# so that other styles do not overwrite the settings::
#
#   mplstyle.use(['dark_background', 'ggplot', 'fast'])
